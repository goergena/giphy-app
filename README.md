# giphy-app

This app uses jQuery and the GIPHY API. 

There are buttons on the page with different animals! Click on one of the buttons and the page populates with gifs for that animal! You can play and pause the gifs. Click a different button and the gifs change. 

You can also add new buttons that will display gifs. Just type it in the search bar and hit Go! The new button will be there for you to click!
